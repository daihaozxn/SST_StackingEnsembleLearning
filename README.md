# SST_StackingEnsembleLearning
This is a repository for SST prediction using the stacking method in ensemble learning.
Stacking are implemented with Keras using TensorFlow 2.3.0 (GPU version) as the backend.
StackedGeneralizationwithConvLSTMMetaModel4.py is stacked generalization with ConvLSTM as meta-learner, and StackedGeneralizationwithConvLSTMMetaModel6.py is stacking's (StackedGeneralizationwithConvLSTMMetaModel4.py) multiple fitting prediction results.
TaiwanStraitSSTPredictionwithPersistentModel1.py is a program to perform persistent prediction.
LoadAndTestXXXSubmodels1.py uses individual model XXX for SST prediction and for stacked generalization.
